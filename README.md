# Fyber_challenge_android

This is an Android application for reference to make some SNS or O2O service on Android. All Android App developer can see how to make some SNS or O2O service on Android via the Fyber source code. The Fyber App currently works well.

My RecyclerFragment is imporved more smooth and more great. Please refer to [RecyclerFragment.java](https://github.com/Lukoh/Fyber_challenge_android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/goforer/base/ui/fragment/RecyclerFragment.java).

All source, which are made by Lukoh(Me), in com.goforer.base package were already used in my opensource project like my [BEatery ](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries) open-source project and other project.

My FyberAndroidChallenge App runs well.
