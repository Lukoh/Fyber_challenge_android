My RecyclerFragment is imporved more smooth and more great. Please refer to [RecyclerFragment.java](https://github.com/Lukoh/Fyber_challenge_android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/goforer/base/ui/fragment/RecyclerFragment.java).

All source, which are made by Lukoh(Me), in goforer.com.base package were already used in my opensource project like my [BEatery ](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries) open-source project and other project.

My FyberAndroidChallenge App runs well.
